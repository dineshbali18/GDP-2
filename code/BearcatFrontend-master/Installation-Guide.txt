This project is already using a firebase project and a cloudinary service for media uploads
so you can just follow these steps to run the app:
- npm run install
- npm run start 


* if you want to integrate your own firebase and cloudinary account then follow these steps

Firebase Setup
- go to https://console.firebase.google.com and create a new project
- create a new web app
- copy and replace the firebaseConfigs in config/firebase.ts file
- go to Authentication-> Sign-in Method, enable Email/password Provider (turn off the Email link if enabled by default)
- go to Firestore Database, create database, choose location and then choose Test/Production mode and create database.

Cloudinary Setup
- go to https://cloudinary.com and create an account
- find the cloudName in settings->API KEYS or in settings->Product Environments
- copy the cloudName and replace it in CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME in constants/index.ts file.
- go to settings-> Uplaod Presets and Add Upload Preset (give it a name, chnage signing mode to Unsigned and save it)
- copy the upload preset name and replace it in CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET in constants/index.ts file.

thats it, now install the dependencies and run the project
- npm run install
